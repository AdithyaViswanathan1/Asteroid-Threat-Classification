(Image needed)

## Dataset

This dataset is from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shrushtijoshi/asteroid-impacts).

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is:
> Develop a system to detect asteroids that would be a threat to life on Earth.

To achieve the main objective, here are sub-objectives:
1. Perform EDA (exploratory data analysis) of asteroid data.
2. Develop supervised machine learning approach to classify fetal health into 3 states.
4. Determine threshold to achieve best results in a medical setting.
5. Deploy model (if time permits)
